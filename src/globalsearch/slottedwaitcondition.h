   * @class SlottedWaitCondition slottedwaitcondition.h <globalsearch/slottedwaitcondition.h>
   *
   * @brief A wrapper for QWaitCondition that has slots for wakeOne
   * and wakeAll. See warning in expanded documentation.
   *
   * @warning Misuse of this class can easily lead to a deadlock. If
   * all calls to the wake* slots are made before wait() is called,
   * the code may hang indefinitely. Ensure that wait() is not called
   * without setting a timeout to prevent this. For similar reasons,
   * it is recommended that this construct is only used for trivial
   * applications, such as GUI updates.
   *
   * This class adds a few new functions to QWaitCondition:
   *   - wakeOneSlot(): A slot that calls QWaitCondition::wakeOne()
   *   - wakeAllSlot(): A slot that calls QWaitCondition::wakeAll()
   *   - mutex(): Returns a pointer to the internal mutex (see below)
   *   - prewaitLock(): A slot that locks the internal mutex (see below)
   *   - postwaitUnlock(): A slot that unlocks the internal mutex (see below)
   *
   * SlottedWaitCondition also includes an internal mutex that can be
   * used for create critical sections before and after calls to
   * wait(). Normally an external mutex is used for this, but calls to
   * wait(), prewaitLock(), and postwaitUnlock() use the internal
   * mutex. Calling mutex() will return a pointer to this
   * mutex. Typical usage of this wait condition is:
@code
SlottedWaitCondition slottedWC;
...
connect(sender, SIGNAL(somethingThatFreesSlottedWCsResources()),
        &slottedWC, SLOT(wakeAllSlot()));

slottedWC->prewaitLock();
// Do any work that needs to be peformed in a critical section before waiting
...

// Check every 250 milliseconds that we still need to be waiting
while (someConditionIsTrue) {
  slottedWC->wait(250);
}

// Do any work that needs to be done in a critical section after waking
...

slottedWC->postwaitUnlock();
@endcode

     * can be unlocked by calling the convenience function
     * postwaitUnlock(). See class description for example usage.
