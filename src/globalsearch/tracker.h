   * @class Tracker tracker.h <globalsearch/tracker.h>
   * @brief The Tracker contains a thread-safe list of unique Structures.
   * @author David C. Lonie
   *
   * In simplest terms, the Tracker class is a list of Structures. It
   * provides convenience functions and signals to facilitate access.
   *
   * The Tracker can be used for storage of all Structures generated
   * in a search, or as a FIFO buffer for pending operations by using
   * the append() and popFirst() functions.
   *
   * If you wish to not use the convenience functions, it is possible
   * to access the list of Structures through list() and the mutex
   * through rwLock(), lockForRead(), lockForWrite(), and unlock().
